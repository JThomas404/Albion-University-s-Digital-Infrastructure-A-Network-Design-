Albion University's Digital Infrastructure: A Network Design üéìüåê
---
Driven by Albion University's vision for a transformative digital infrastructure across two campuses, this project sought a dynamic network solution tailored to faculty and department needs.
___
Design Overview:
---
Drawing inspiration from Albion University's coursework brief, the design blueprint seamlessly integrates the administrative, academic, and IT functions across both campuses into a unified network ecosystem.
___
Main Campus Highlights:
---
Building A hosts Administrative and Business Faculty operations, employing VLANs for efficient resource sharing among management, HR, and finance departments.
___
**Building B** combines the Engineering/Computing and Art/Design faculties, facilitating collaborative and interdisciplinary connectivity.

**Building C** is dedicated to student labs and the IT department, which houses the University Web server among other critical servers, ensuring robust support for academic pursuits.

Smaller Campus Insight:
---
The Faculty of Health and Sciences is strategically placed to support both staff and students, with distinct networking considerations for labs on separate floors, enhancing the educational experience.
___
Networking Strategy:
---
Departmental Distinction: Each department/faculty is allocated its own IP network, with VLANs and security settings meticulously configured to ensure data integrity and seamless operation.
___
Routing and Connectivity: 
---
RIPv2 handles internal routing, complemented by static routing for external server access, ensuring comprehensive connectivity to both internal and cloud-based resources.
___
Dynamic IP Allocation: 
---
Building A benefits from a router-based DHCP server, simplifying network management and ensuring efficient device connectivity.
Implementation and Evaluation:

Employing Cisco Packet Tracer, I embarked on a journey to not only design but also configure a network that stands as a testament to modern networking principles. This project was a profound learning experience, honing my skills in network planning, VLAN segmentation, routing configurations, and security implementations.
